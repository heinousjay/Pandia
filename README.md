# Pandia

## A declarative page object factory for selenium.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/heinousjay/Pandia.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/heinousjay/Pandia)


### What is it?

Pandia provides a simple interface-based DSL for describing your web pages, and a Junit test rule for managing
web driver resources during your tests.


### Where is it going?

1. better handling of URL parameters
2. better example code
3. cleaner code gen facilities for better extensibility
4. extraction of the gradle plugin for PhantomJS setup
5. publication to maven central


### Why the name?

Pandia is the the deification of the moon and daughter of the goddess Selene, so it's sort of related
to selenium.  I really just wanted a nicer name than "WebTest" and this seems like a winner.
